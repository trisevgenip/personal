#  Auxiliary Hypotheses in Belief Revision
When faced with information that contradicts core beliefs, individuals use various strategies to reconcile the conflict and preserve a coherent worldview. Contradictory observations can be “explained away”, effectively by modifying or adding "nodes" to one's mental framework to explain the discrepancy.

## Questions we are investigating

* 🤯 What are the factors that influence the adoption of auxiliary hypotheses and explanations in information conflicts?
* 🤝 Under what conditions do individuals prioritise coherence over accuracy or resource-rationality when updating their belief networks?
* 🌐 How do revisions to core vs peripheral nodes differ in cognitive demands and their effects on belief network structure, and what conditions prompt new model adoption?
